This game is a modified version of Tic Tac Toe.
It also is a 2 Player game but instead of each player
playing with one variable i.e. X and O we have two variables
for each player say X1, X2 and O1,O2. Here each player has
to play in the specified order i.e. X1-O1-X2-O2 and X1 again,
and so on.

Rules to play this game : 
1.X1 and O1 variables have to be placed in an empty spot.
2.X2 can replace O1 only and similarly O2 can replace X1 only.

Consider its Player 1's turn to place its X2 variable, in this
case he has two options : 
1.Place it on an empty spot(ideal way of playing).
2.Replace an existing O1's place.

Winning Conditions :
The winning conditions are same as that of the Vanilla Tic
Tac Toe, i.e. you need 3 X's or O's (irrespective of whether
it is X1 or X2) in a row, column or diagonal.

Tie Conditions :
In our game this condition is a little rare to occur. It can
be a tie  
1.When the board has no empty spot and the next player to 
play is either X1 or O1 (since they have to be placed in an
empty spot.)
2.When the board has no empty spot and the next player to 
play is either X2 or O2. In this case the player has an 
advantage since he has a chance to overlap an existing
appropriate variable to either create a winning condition
for itself or it'll still be a tie.
