*Q. 3 Explain the deployment of your game for playing 
on the server.*

Our game's backend is an NodeJS web application, 
also there is no any kind of database used in our 
project, so deploying it to cloud platform is cheap 
and in some cases free (limited bandwidth, hours).
 Also since there is no CPU intensive, memory intensive
 and bandwidth intensive tasks on server side, a thin 
server would be suffice for our project. Cloud services
 like AWS, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud, Heroku, etc can
 be used to deploy the game backend. Mainly, Heroku is
 easier to use, maintain and their free plan is 
sufficient for our project.
